# Notebook Set 4
In this notebook set, you will use linear and Poisson modeling to assess the strength of relationship between independent and dependent variables. For parts 1 and 2, you can choose whatever (python) visualization package you like to create the graphics -- the important thing is to create charts that facilitate comparisons of the data and reveal important patterns. In particular, you will do the following:

**`part-1.ipynb`**: Use exploratory data analysis and statistical tests (t tests, ANOVA) to assess **differences in mean salary** by gender (`male`, `female`) and rank (`assistant`, `associate`, `full`) professors.

**`part-2.ipynb`**: Using the same dataset, build linear models that assess the strength of relationship between characteristics (rank, sex, years of experience) and salary.

**`poisson.pdf`**: Before creating the notebook in `part-3.Rmd`, **read** [this](poisson.pdf) summary of Poisson modeling that has been written for you.

**`part-3.Rmd`**: Use RMarkdown to build a report based on this [blog post](https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/r/dae/poisson-regression/). The purpose is for you to add **meaningful annotation** to the code in the blog post. In other words, you will end up copying and pasting the code from the blog post (yes, you are _supposed to_ do this). We want you to add markdown text to the code that explains _what the code is doing_ and _what relationships it reveals_. In doing so, you should **use your own words** so that this acts as a reference for you in the future.
