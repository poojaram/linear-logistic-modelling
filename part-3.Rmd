## Poisson regression example
This notebook will be built based on [this blog post](https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/r/dae/poisson-regression/). You will include many markdown comments (like this one!) to describe the code used and insights generated.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# Set up code block -- don't print ("include") results. 
# This is a good place to load data / packages

# **Read** the poisson.pdf overview, then
# implement the Poisson regression described in this tutorial:
# https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/r/dae/poisson-regression/
# You should **copy and paste** code from that tutorial (or accomplish
# the same ends using different code, if you prefer). 
# Make sure to **add markdown annotation** describing what your code does, 
# and how you can interpret the results. 

```
